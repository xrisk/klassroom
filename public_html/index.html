      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>Welcome, fellow ICSE student. What, is it Interfaces in Java this time? Mole Concept in Chemistry? Mitosis? Or is Physics too much 'work' for you?</p>
      <p>Fear not, you've come to the right place. Here, at Klassroom 14, the content is student-friendly and caters specifically for the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education. We know, you've heard that before,right?</p>
      <p>But here, the notes and resources are written by us, and we too are ICSE students. And we too have difficulty understanding how centrifugal force works. So, all the content here is for the students and by the students.</p>
      <p>Because it takes one genius to know another.</p>
      <p>This page is under development. Come again in a week or two.</p>

          The prime reason the Google home page is so bare is due to the fact that the founders didn’t know HTML and just wanted a quick interface. In fact it was noted that the submit button was a long time coming and hitting the RETURN key was the only way to burst Google into life.
