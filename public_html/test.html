		<center><h1>Hello, World!</h1>
			<p>Welcome, fellow ICSE student. What, is it Interfaces in Java this time? Mole Concept in Chemistry? Mitosis? Or is Physics too much 'work' for you?

Fear not, you've come to the right place. Here, at Klassroom 14, the content is student-friendly and caters specifically for the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education. We know, you've heard that before,right?

But here, the notes and resources are written by us, and we too are ICSE students. And we too have difficulty understanding how centrifugal force works. So, all the content here is for the students and by the students.



Because it takes one genius to know another.

This page is under development. Come again in a week or two.
Meanwhile, see who made us what we are.

We've got some stuff on Physics, guys! Very little but something. Check it out. And drop us a line at admin@klassroom.url.ph if you have anything to tell us.
